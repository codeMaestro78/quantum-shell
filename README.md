# Quantum Shell for Github's Atom Text Editor
A command line interface built directly into Atom! This package is largely inspired
by (but not a direct fork of) [terminal-panel](http://github.com/thedaniel/terminal-panel).
The goal of this project is to provide users with a simple, yet powerful tool, that
no self-proclaimed 'Hackable' editor should be without. It will maintain strict compliance
to the 1.0.0-pre Atom API for now, and once its official, the 1.x API. Currently, this
package should run as expected on Atom >=0.174.0 with any standard Linux machine. Cross-platform
compatibility is an eventual goal as are many other things (see the CHANGELOG for details).
To get started just search for and download 'quantum-shell' in the Atom package manager and press `ctrl-shift-q` to get started. Happy Hacking!
